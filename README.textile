h1. jCheck Rails

jCheck Rails provide a ease way to generate "jCheck":http://jcheck.net code
to validate forms according to ActiveModel record validations.

h2. Installation

Just configure your Gemfile with

bc. gem 'jcheck_rails'

h2. Basic Usage

To include @jcheck_rails@ in your application is simple. Just download the latest version of "jCheck":http://jcheck.net, extract the files and place them in the correct directories (js, in the javascripts folder and css in stylessheets). Then include the files in your layout.


With the library included, on your form views add the following:

bc. <%= jcheck_for resource %>

Replace @resource@ with the instance variable of the resource for form e.g. @@user@. This will
use reflection, to detect the model validations and will convert these to @jCheck@.

It's highly recommended that you read the @jCheck@ documentation at
"http://jcheck.net/documentation":http://jcheck.net/documentation for a full
overview on @jCheck@.
