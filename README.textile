h1. jCheck Rails

jCheck Rails provide a ease way to generate "jCheck":http://jcheck.net code
to validate form according to ActiveModel record validations.

h2. Installation

Just configure your Gemfile with

bc. gem 'jcheck_rails'

h2. Basic Usage

To make a basic usage of @jcheck_rails@ is really simple, first you need to
setup your application view to use jcheck, to make it just go to "jCheck site":http://jcheck.net,
download the latest version, drop the files in your public directory (the zip
contains the correct folders, js in javascripts folder and css in stylesheets
folder), and them add there files in you layout.

With the front-end setup done, go to your form and do:

bc. <%= jcheck_for @post %>

Replace the @@post@ with variable of your object to current form. This will
make a reflection into your model validations and will write the respective
ones using @jCheck@.

It's highly recommendable that you read the @jCheck@ documentation at
"http://jcheck.net/documentation":http://jcheck.net/documentation for a full
knowledge on @jCheck@.
